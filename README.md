My first project related to Cybersecurity and the biggest in scale ever made by me, 
My project ***evaluates password complexity based on length, character types, and common patterns,*** using detectors that detect weak passwords and 1337 typing.
This types of projects are ***important*** in today's society, since many users use the internet, and some are bound to make weak, easy-to-break-in passwords, This puts their security and privacy in risk, which could end very badly. If good password evaluator are abundant, they can avoid this. 
##
## What does my project cover?:
1. 1337 typing: The program has a leet map which detects 5¥/V\ß015(Symbols) to skip basic weak passwords like admin(@dm!n, 4dm1n) or password(p@55w0rd, 9@55w0rd).
2. Weak base passwords: The program takes statistically, the weakest passwords. Using a weak passwords always gives a "Very bad" evaluation, due to it's weakness.
3. Password entropy: The program will have a built-in password entropy, it will detect whether 12March1997 is stronger than 2#JFWfwcmsa@#01_3o.
