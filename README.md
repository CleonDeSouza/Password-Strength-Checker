My first project related to Cybersecurity, it evaluates password complexity based on string length, character types and symbols, and common patterns, using detectors that detect unsecure passwords, entropy analysis and 1337 typing.

# Why do projects like this matter?:

Password Entropy projects are fundamental in today's society. 67,9% of the world uses the internet, and some of these people are bound to make weak, easy-to-break-in passwords, this puts their security and privacy at risk. Stronger password evaluator that have similar functions as mine can be implemented in web apps or software to evaluate these passwords.

# What does my project evaluate?:

***1. 1337 typing***: The program has a leet map which detects 5¥/V\ß015(Symbols) to skip basic weak passwords like admin(@dm!n, 4dm1n) or password(p@55w0rd, 9@55w0rd).  
***2. Weak base passwords***: The program takes statistically, the weakest passwords. Using a weak passwords always gives a "Very bad" evaluation, due to it's weakness.  
***3. Password entropy***: The program will have a built-in password entropy, it will detect whether 12March1997 is stronger than 2#JFWfwcmsa@#01_3.
