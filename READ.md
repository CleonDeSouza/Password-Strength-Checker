My first project related to Cybersecurity, 
This project is supposed to ***evaluate password complexity based on length, character types, and common patterns.***

These are concepts taught and learnt in general:
1. Password Security  
2. re & string modules  
3. 2FA & RBAC  
4. Session management (cookies, tokens)


 __- Day/Week - Amount of effort - Reason of effort__

  ## - 1/1  - Little - FQ test
  simple basic concepts(like Password Security)  
  addition of python modules like re, string
